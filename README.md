Project description:
- Creating a "backpack" electronics enclosure for Voron V2.4 3D printer to relocate the electronics from the under-skirt bay to a more accessible area.
- Orienting the electronics in such a way that they are visible from inside of the enclosure for aesthetic purposes.

Target:
- Voron V2.4r2 300mm (but can be adapted to the 250mm and 350mm versions easily).

Design constraints:
- 2020 aluminum extrusion frame.
- 3D printed skirts designed to replicate the aesthetic of the original Voron skirts with hexagonal cutouts.
- Electronics backpack must hinge open from the bottom, and open position must be 90 degrees from the vertical struts of the printer's frame, making the service platform much more easily accessible compared to the under-skirt electronics bay concept.
- "Internal" panel of the electronics backpack which faces the printing enclosure should be a 3mm clear acrylic panel to leave electronic components protected but visible during operation.
- Must be no need for intricate manipulation of hardware infrastructure in order to open/close the backpack.
- When backpack is in "closed" position, the backpack must lock positively into the frame using a spring-loaded mechanism with decent preloading to avoid the backpack falling open from normal vibrations during regular operation.

Advantages vs. original electronics bay:
- Easier access for service (don't have to flip the printer upside-down or on its side for electronics bay access - just spin it 180 degrees and pop the backpack open.
- Potential for additional visible lighting elements.
- End user is forced to disconnect mains power cable to open electronics bay, further limiting risk of harm while working in the electronics bay.

Disadvantages vs. original electronics bay:
- Significant extension of most cabling required.
- Ability to cut 2020 extrusion to a reasonable degree of accuracy required.
- 3D printer capable of printing somehwat complex multi-part assemblies required.
